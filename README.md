## INSTALLATION

### CocoaPods:

To use PasscodeKit with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), specify in your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'PasscodeKit', :git => 'https://github.com/iamStephenFang/PasscodeKit.git', :branch => 'master'
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the dependency managers, you can integrate `PasscodeKit` into your project manually. Just copy the contents of the `Sources` folder into your Xcode project.

## REQUIREMENTS

- iOS 12.0+

## QUICKSTART

To activate the PasscodeKit in your codebase, you need to start it right after the app is launched. The best practice to do it in the AppDelegate `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.

```swift
PasscodeKit.start()
```

The following `PasscodeKitDelegate` methods can be used to take actions related to the PasscodeKit user activity.

```swift
func passcodeCheckedButDisabled()

func passcodeEnteredSuccessfully()

func passcodeMaximumFailedAttempts()
```

To enable, disable the passcode functionality, or to change the saved passcode you can use the following methods.

```swift
PasscodeKit.createPasscode(self)

PasscodeKit.changePasscode(self)

PasscodeKit.removePasscode(self)
```

The following `PasscodeKitDelegate` methods can be used to receive notifications when the password interval is changed.

```swift
func passcodeIntervalChanged()
```

## CUSTOMIZATION

The following settings are available for customizing the passcode-related user experience.

```swift
PasscodeKit.passcodeLength = 4

PasscodeKit.allowedFailedAttempts = 3
```

```swift
PasscodeKit.textColor = .darkText
PasscodeKit.backgroundColor = .lightGray

PasscodeKit.failedTextColor = .white
PasscodeKit.failedBackgroundColor = .systemRed
```

```swift
PasscodeKit.titleEnterPasscode = "Enter Passcode"
PasscodeKit.titleCreatePasscode = "Create Passcode"
PasscodeKit.titleChangePasscode = "Change Passcode"
PasscodeKit.titleRemovePasscode = "Remove Passcode"

PasscodeKit.textEnterPasscode = "Enter your passcode"
PasscodeKit.textVerifyPasscode = "Verify your passcode"
PasscodeKit.textEnterOldPasscode = "Enter your old passcode"
PasscodeKit.textEnterNewPasscode = "Enter your new passcode"
PasscodeKit.textVerifyNewPasscode = "Verify your new passcode"
PasscodeKit.textFailedPasscode = "%d Failed Passcode Attempts"
PasscodeKit.textPasscodeMismatch = "Passcodes did not match. Try again."
PasscodeKit.textBiometricAccessReason = "Please use Touch ID to unlock the app"
PasscodeKit.textBiometricAccessTip = "Allow to use Face ID (or Touch ID) to unlock the app"
```

```swift
PasscodeKit.vefifyPasscodeImmediately  = "Immediately"
PasscodeKit.vefifyPasscodeAfterMinutes = "After %.f minutes"
PasscodeKit.vefifyPasscodeAfterOneHour = "After an hour"
```

## CONFIGURATION

PasscodeKit supports both TouchID and FaceID. If you're using FaceID, be sure to add the `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` details into your Info.plist file.
